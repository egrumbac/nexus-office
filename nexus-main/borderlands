# Borderlands

Find Resources and Collab via Platform

vs.

Active Coll and Work, Locally or Online

vs. 

Series of Programming (workshops, talks) livestreamed

vs. 

All of the above

## Possibilities

- Aggregate Events (does Hemi Center do this?)
- Resources Bibliography
- Commons space online
- Webinars, Livestreams (student recaps)
- Affiliated Research Projects
- Books/Reviews/Interviews on HASTAC.org
- Fellows (teaching, staff time, collab?)
- Online/local reading group
- Digital exhibit

## Questions 

- How to support multi-lingual platform/programming? (Tempe becoming HSI)
- Does HASTAC seek to destabilize the US-centric focus of many borderland studies units?
- What do non-borderland HASTAC scholars/scientists need to be able to find such an engagement meaningful and productive for their own scholarship?
- How can we find/speak to/help boost current border-focused research, activism, art in Arizona?

## Themes
- Health/Medicine and Hemispheric Studies/Border Studies
- Digital feminstas
- Nepantla & Digital Space
